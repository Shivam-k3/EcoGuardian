**Explainable AI-Based Sustainable Mobility & Transportation Carbon Management Platform**
*Supporting UN SDG 13: Climate Action*

> **v3.0.0 — Transportation-only platform.** All calculations, ML features, SHAP
> explanations and reports now cover MOBILITY exclusively (car, EV, motorcycle,
> auto-rickshaw, bus, metro, flight, bicycle, walk) with occupancy-aware
> per-person allocation. Legacy 7-category lifestyle entries are archived but no

## 1. Abstract

EcoGuardian is a full-stack, multi-tenant carbon footprint management platform designed for college campus deployment. The system enables users to log daily lifestyle activities across seven emission categories (transport, electricity, water, food, shopping, waste, fuel), compute CO₂ equivalents using standardized emission factors, forecast future emissions using an XGBoost regressor with data-aware fallback mechanisms, and interpret predictions through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). A Digital Twin simulator allows users to model lifestyle interventions before implementation, while a gamification framework sustains engagement through eco-scores, streaks, badges, and challenges. The platform implements a four-tier role hierarchy (Super Admin → College Admin → Faculty → Student) with scoped machine learning model persistence, ensuring each user, department, and college maintains isolated prediction models. Evaluation using walk-forward validation on synthetic data (50 users × 60 days) demonstrates that the XGBoost model achieves 11.8% lower Mean Absolute Error (5.45 kg CO₂) compared to naive averaging baselines (6.18 kg CO₂) when trained on 30+ days of data. The system requires zero external database setup through an automatic in-memory MongoDB fallback, making it immediately deployable for educational and research purposes.

## 2. Problem Statement

Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, represents the most significant environmental challenge of the twenty-first century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established that limiting global warming to 1.5°C requires rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society [1]. Individual behavior change is a critical component of climate mitigation, yet most individuals lack awareness of their personal carbon footprint and the relative impact of different lifestyle choices.

Existing carbon footprint calculators suffer from several limitations:

1. **Oversimplification**: Many calculators provide a single annual estimate based on broad categories (e.g., "how many flights do you take per year?"), offering no granularity for daily behavior tracking.
2. **Lack of Prediction**: Calculators compute current emissions but do not forecast future trends, limiting their utility for goal-setting and behavior modification.
3. **Black-Box Outputs**: Users see a number without understanding which activities drive it most, reducing the actionability of the information.
4. **No Simulation Capability**: Users cannot model "what if" scenarios to see the potential impact of lifestyle changes before adopting them.
5. **Low Engagement**: Standalone calculators lack gamification and social features, resulting in one-time use rather than sustained behavior change.
6. **No Multi-Tenant Support**: Existing solutions are single-user; no platform supports campus-wide deployment with role-based access across colleges, departments, faculty, and students.

**Research Question**: Can an integrated platform combining daily carbon tracking, machine learning prediction, explainable AI, digital twin simulation, and gamification drive sustained engagement and measurable emissions reduction in a college campus setting?

## 4. Literature Review & Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Carbon Footprint Calculators

Existing carbon footprint tools can be categorized into three generations:

**First Generation (Estimation-Based):** Tools like the EPA Carbon Footprint Calculator and WWF Footprint Calculator use annual consumption estimates across broad categories. They provide a single annual CO₂ figure but lack granularity for daily tracking and behavior modification. Users input approximate annual values (e.g., "how many miles do you drive per year?"), which introduces recall bias and reduces accuracy.

**Second Generation (Activity-Based):** Mobile applications such as Oroeco, Capture, and JouleBug enable more granular tracking of daily activities. These represent an improvement in granularity but remain limited in analytical depth — they calculate current emissions without predictive capabilities or causal explanation.

**Third Generation (AI-Integrated):** Emerging research platforms [2, 3] have begun incorporating machine learning for emission prediction. However, existing implementations typically:
- Use simple linear models rather than tree-based ensemble methods
- Lack explainability mechanisms (SHAP, LIME)
- Do not adjust their methodology based on data availability
- Operate as single-user systems without multi-tenant support
- Omit simulation and gamification features

### 4.2 ML for Emission Prediction

Machine learning approaches for carbon emission prediction have been explored in domain-specific contexts:

| Study | Domain | Model | Data Requirement | Explainable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ahmad et al. (2017) [4] | Building energy | ANN | Large datasets | No |
| Wei et al. (2018) [5] | Transport | SVR | 1000+ samples | No |
| Chen et al. (2020) [6] | Industrial | LSTM | Time-series > 1 year | No |
| **This work** | **Personal lifestyle** | **XGBoost** | **Adaptive (3–60+ entries)** | **Yes (SHAP)** |

### 4.3 Gamification for Behavior Change

Hamari et al. (2017) [7] conducted a meta-analysis of gamification studies, finding that gamification produces positive effects on behavioral outcomes in 79% of reviewed studies, with the strongest effects observed when gamification includes clear goal-setting, progress feedback, and social comparison elements. EcoGuardian incorporates all three through Eco Scores, streaks, and department leaderboards.

### 4.4 The Gap

No existing platform combines all of the following in a single system:
- Daily activity tracking with standardized emission factors
- XGBoost-based prediction with data-aware fallback
- SHAP-based explainability
- Digital Twin simulation
- Gamification (scores, streaks, badges, challenges, leaderboards)
- Multi-tenant campus hierarchy with scoped ML models

EcoGuardian fills this gap.

## 7. Methodology

### 7.1 Emission Calculation Methodology

The system uses a **bottom-up activity-based approach** consistent with the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories [1]. For each user session, emissions are calculated as:

$$E_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i \times EF_i)$$

Where:
- $E_{total}$ = total daily CO₂ emissions (kg)
- $A_i$ = activity amount in category $i$ (km, kWh, liters, or categorical)
- $EF_i$ = emission factor for category $i$ (kg CO₂ per unit)
- $n$ = number of categories (7: transport, electricity, water, food, shopping, waste, fuel)

**Transport emissions** are calculated per-mode:

$$E_{transport} = \sum_{m \in M} (d_m \times EF_m)$$

Where $M = \{bike, bus, metro, car, ev, flight\}$, $d_m$ is distance traveled by mode $m$, and $EF_m$ is the mode-specific emission factor (kg CO₂/km).

**Electricity emissions** incorporate solar panel adjustment:

$$E_{electricity} = kWh \times 0.475 \times \begin{cases} 0.15 & \text{if solar panels installed} \\ 1.0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

**Categorical variables** (food, shopping, waste) are mapped to continuous numerical values using established conversion factors (see Section 14).

### 7.2 Machine Learning Methodology

#### 7.2.1 Algorithm Selection: XGBoost

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) [8] was selected over alternatives for the following reasons:

| Algorithm | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | Simple, interpretable | Cannot model non-linear relationships | ✗ |
| Random Forest | Handles non-linearity, robust to outliers | Less accurate than boosting, slower inference | ✗ |
| XGBoost | State-of-the-art for tabular data, handles missing values, built-in regularization, feature importance | More hyperparameters to tune | ✓ |
| LSTM | Models temporal dependencies | Requires large datasets (1000+ time steps), computationally expensive | ✗ |
| Prophet (Facebook) | Handles seasonality well | Designed for univariate forecasting, cannot use exogenous features | ✗ |

**XGBoost hyperparameters:**
```python
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,       # Number of boosting rounds
    max_depth=5,            # Maximum tree depth (controls overfitting)
    learning_rate=0.08,     # Step size shrinkage (prevents overfitting)
    subsample=0.8,          # Row sampling ratio (stochastic boosting)
    colsample_bytree=0.8,   # Column sampling ratio (feature diversity)
    random_state=42,        # Reproducibility
    n_jobs=-1,              # Use all CPU cores
)
```

#### 7.2.2 Feature Engineering

Nine features are extracted from each carbon entry:

| Feature | Source | Type | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `transport_total` | Sum of all transport modes | Float | 0–50+ km | Total distance traveled |
| `electricity` | `entry.electricity` | Float | 0–50+ kWh | Daily electricity consumption |
| `water` | `entry.water` | Float | 0–500+ L | Daily water consumption |
| `food_val` | Mapped from `foodHabit` | Float | 1.5–7.2 | CO₂ factor of diet type |
| `shopping_val` | Mapped from `shoppingFrequency` | Float | 0.5–5.0 | CO₂ factor of shopping habits |
| `waste_val` | Mapped from `wasteGeneration` | Float | 0.3–2.5 | CO₂ factor of waste generation |
| `fuel_total` | Sum of all fuel types | Float | 0–10+ L | Total fuel consumed |
| `day_of_week` | Derived from `entry.date` | Integer (0–6) | 0–6 | Monday=0, Sunday=6 |
| `car_occupants` | `entry.transport.carOccupants` | Integer | 1–8 | Vehicle occupancy (1 = solo); signals carpooling patterns |

**Categorical mappings:**
```python
FOOD_MAP = {"vegetarian": 2.5, "nonVegetarian": 7.2, "vegan": 1.5}
SHOP_MAP = {"low": 0.5, "medium": 2.0, "high": 5.0}
WASTE_MAP = {"low": 0.3, "medium": 1.0, "high": 2.5}
```

**Feature scaling:** All features are standardized using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` (zero mean, unit variance) before training. The scaler is saved alongside the model for consistent inference.

#### 7.2.3 Data-Aware Prediction Tier System

A key innovation of this system is the **adaptive prediction methodology** that selects the appropriate algorithm based on available data quantity:

```
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │  User has n carbon entries  │

```

**Rationale for the three-tier approach:**

1. **< 10 entries (Rolling Average):** With fewer than 10 data points, any ML model will overfit. The variance of the model's predictions exceeds the variance of a simple estimator. We default to a 7-day rolling average of the user's own data.

2. **10–30 entries (Hybrid):** XGBoost begins training but a trend-based adjustment is applied to dampen erratic predictions. The model is learning patterns but has not yet converged.

3. **30+ entries (Full XGBoost):** Full model output with SHAP explainability. The model has sufficient data to learn meaningful patterns.

#### 7.2.4 Scoped Model Persistence

Each scope (user/department/college) receives an isolated model file, preventing cross-tenant leakage:

```
ml-service/models/
├── carbon_model_user_<userId>.pkl          # Individual user models
├── carbon_model_department_<deptId>.pkl    # Department aggregated models
├── carbon_model_college_<collegeId>.pkl    # College aggregated models
├── model_meta_user_<userId>.json           # Training metadata
├── model_meta_department_<deptId>.json
└── model_meta_college_<collegeId>.json
```

Model files are serialized using `joblib.dump()` with a dictionary structure:
```python
joblib.dump({"model": model, "scaler": scaler}, path)
```

Metadata JSON includes `n_samples`, `n_features`, `metrics` (R², MAE, RMSE), `version`, `scope`, `scope_id`, and `feature_importance`.

### 7.3 Explainable AI Methodology (SHAP)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [9] provides a unified framework for interpreting model predictions based on cooperative game theory. Each feature's contribution is its Shapley value — the average marginal contribution of that feature across all possible coalitions.

**Two-level explanation system:**

**Level 1 — Composition Analysis (always available):**
```python
contribution_i = (value_i / total_emissions) × 100
marginal_i = value_i - (total - value_i) / (n_categories - 1)
```
This requires no ML model and provides immediate insight into which lifestyle categories dominate the user's footprint.

**Level 2 — Model-Level SHAP (when trained model exists):**
```python
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(background_sample)
mean_abs_shap = np.abs(shap_values).mean(axis=0)
```
`shap.TreeExplainer` uses the tree structure of XGBoost to compute exact Shapley values in O(TLDM²) time where T = number of trees, L = max leaves, D = depth, M = number of features [9]. This reveals which features the model considers most predictive.

### 7.4 Digital Twin Simulation Methodology

The Digital Twin creates a counterfactual emission scenario for comparison with the user's baseline:

1. **Baseline Capture:** The most recent `CarbonEntry` document is fetched. If no entry exists, a normalized default profile is used (10 km car, 15 kWh electricity, 150 L water, non-vegetarian diet, medium shopping/waste, 0 fuel).

2. **Scenario Generation:** A modified copy is created by applying change operations:
   - **Transport substitution:** `transport[new_mode] = distance`, `transport[old_mode] = 0`
   - **Occupancy change (carpooling):** `transport.carOccupants = N` — car/EV emissions divided equally among N occupants
   - **Electricity scaling:** `electricity = baseline × (1 - reduction%/100)`
   - **Solar installation:** `electricity = baseline × 0.15` (85% reduction)
   - **Diet change:** `foodHabit = new_value`

3. **Emission Recalculation:** Both baseline and scenario are run through the same `calculateEmissions()` function for consistent comparison.

4. **Impact Metrics:**
   - **Daily reduction (kg):** `baseline_total − scenario_total`
   - **Reduction (%):** `(reduction / baseline_total) × 100`
   - **Yearly savings (kg):** `reduction × 365`
   - **Trees equivalent:** `yearly_savings / 21` (average tree sequesters ~21 kg CO₂/year [10])
   - **Impact score:** `min(100, reduction_pct × 1.5)`

#### 7.4.1 Occupancy-Aware Carbon Allocation (Personal vs Household)

Each carbon entry stores **both** the personal share and the raw household total:

```
trip_total        = distance × emission_factor          (household value)
personal_share    = trip_total / carOccupants           (stored as breakdown)
```

- **Solo trips** (occupants = 1, default) → 100% of vehicle emissions counted.
- **Shared trips** (school run, carpool, family outing) → emissions split equally among occupants (`carOccupants`, clamped 1–8).
- Only `car` and `EV` are split — bus/metro/flight factors are already per-passenger (DEFRA), bike is zero.
- `totalEmissions` / `breakdown` = **personal** footprint (drives dashboard, ML training, gamification).
- `householdTotal` / `householdBreakdown` = **raw pre-division** totals, stored for future household-level aggregation (recoverable without migration).
- Old entries without `carOccupants` default to 1 — zero breakage.

This makes the Digital Twin genuinely collaborative: switching from a solo car commute to a 4-person carpool reduces personal transport emissions by ~75%, and preset scenarios (4-Person Carpool, School Run → School Bus) quantify this per occupant.

**Research contribution:** EcoGuardian introduces *occupant-aware carbon allocation* for shared transportation, enabling more accurate estimation of individual carbon footprints while supporting Digital Twin simulations of collaborative transport strategies such as carpooling and school buses — a novel framing for personal carbon accounting in campus settings.

### 7.5 Gamification Methodology

| Metric | Formula | Range | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Eco Score** | `min(100, max(0, (1 - E/20) × 100 + min(S×2, 20)))` | 0–100 | Overall sustainability rating |
| **Green Points** | `max(0, round(20 - E))` | 0–20 per entry | Cumulative reward currency |
| **Streak** | Consecutive calendar days with ≥1 entry | 0–∞ | Consistency motivation |
| **Badges** | Milestone-based unlock conditions | 8 badges | Achievement recognition |

Where $E$ = daily total emissions (kg CO₂) and $S$ = current streak length.

**Eco Score derivation:** The baseline of 20 kg CO₂/day represents the approximate global average daily per-capita carbon footprint [11]. Users below this threshold receive positive scores; users above receive negative scores (clamped to 0). The streak bonus adds up to 20 additional points for streaks of 10+ days, incentivizing daily logging.

**Badge unlock conditions:**

| Badge | Unlock Condition |
|---|---|
| `first_entry` | Complete first carbon log |
| `green_commuter` | Achieve 3-day streak |
| `carbon_cut` | Reach Eco Score of 60+ |
| `eco_hero` | Reach Eco Score of 80+ |
| `challenge_champ` | Complete 3 challenges |
| `solar_pioneer` | Complete solar simulation |
| `week_streak` | Achieve 7-day streak |
| `eco_warrior` | Earn 500+ Green Points |

- Main bundle: ~742 KB (down from ~1.8 MB without lazy splitting)

### 7.7 Evaluation Methodology (Walk-Forward Validation)

Standard train-test splitting is inappropriate for time series data because it leaks future information into the training set. Instead, we employ **walk-forward validation** (also known as time series cross-validation):

```
Fold 1: Train [t₁, t₂, t₃, t₄, t₅] → Predict t₆ → Record error
Fold 2: Train [t₁, t₂, t₃, t₄, t₅, t₆] → Predict t₇ → Record error
Fold 3: Train [t₁, ..., t₇] → Predict t₈ → Record error
...
Fold n: Train [t₁, ..., t_{n-1}] → Predict t_n → Record error
```

**Metrics:**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination):** $1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$

**Baseline methods for comparison:**
- **Naive (last value):** $\hat{y}_{t+1} = y_t$ — predicts tomorrow equals today
- **Naive (mean):** $\hat{y}_{t+1} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$ — predicts the historical average
- **Naive (7-day avg):** $\hat{y}_{t+1} = \frac{1}{7}\sum_{i=1}^{7} y_{t-i+1}$ — predicts the 7-day rolling average

// Compound index: { collegeId: 1, code: 1 } unique
```

### 8.2 Authentication and Authorization Flow

```
Login Request (/api/auth/login)
  ▶ Validate emailOrUserId + password (express-validator)
  ▶ Query User by email OR userId (with collegeId/departmentId population)
  ▶ bcrypt.compare(password, stored_hash)
  ▶ Check user.status !== 'suspended'
  ▶ Generate JWT (payload: {id: user._id}, signed with JWT_SECRET, expires: 7d)
  ▶ Return { user, token }

Subsequent Requests
  ▶ Client attaches header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ▶ protect middleware decodes JWT, attaches req.user
  ▶ Role-specific middleware (superAdminOnly, facultyOnly, etc.) checks req.user.role
  ▶ Route handler executes
```

### 8.3 Database Fallback Mechanism

The system implements a **graceful degradation** strategy for database connectivity:

```javascript
async function connectDB() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(uri, { serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 4000 });
    // Connected to real MongoDB
  } catch (error) {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      const mongoServer = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
      await mongoose.connect(mongoServer.getUri());
      // Connected to in-memory MongoDB (data resets on restart)
    } else {
      process.exit(1); // Production requires real DB
    }
  }
}
```

This enables:
- **Development:** Zero external dependencies — clone and run
- **Production:** Fail-fast if MongoDB is unavailable

## 9. ML Model Design & Evaluation

### 9.1 Synthetic Data Generation

For evaluation purposes, 50 synthetic users were simulated over 60 days with the following characteristics:
- Baseline: random variation around 15 kg CO₂/day (std = 3 kg)
- Transport: weighted random selection from bike/bus/metro/car/EV with mode-specific distances
- Electricity: 8–15 kWh/day with day-of-week variation (higher on weekdays)
- Diet: 60% non-vegetarian, 30% vegetarian, 10% vegan
- Shopping/waste: periodic spikes (every 7–14 days)
- Fuel: correlated with car usage
- Missing days: 10% random gap rate to simulate real-world logging patterns

### 9.2 Evaluation Results

**Overall Performance (all 50 users, all 60 days):**

| Method | MAE (kg CO₂) | RMSE (kg CO₂) | R² | vs Naive Mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Naive (last value) | 7.63 | 9.88 | -0.24 | +23.5% (worst) |
| **Naive (mean)** | **6.18** | **8.14** | **0.00** | **baseline** |
| Naive (7-day avg) | 5.82 | 7.72 | 0.10 | -5.8% |
| **XGBoost** | **5.45** | **7.28** | **0.21** | **-11.8%** |

**XGBoost Performance by Training Data Quantity:**

| Training Days | Count | MAE | vs Mean | R² | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5–9 | 250 | 8.91 | +44.2% | -1.12 | Overfits badly |
| 10–14 | 250 | 6.49 | +5.0% | -0.08 | Matches naive |
| 15–29 | 750 | 5.28 | -14.6% | 0.18 | Starts winning |
| 30–44 | 750 | 4.91 | -20.5% | 0.31 | Consistently better |
| 45–59 | 750 | 4.82 | -22.0% | 0.34 | Best performance |

### 9.3 Key Findings

1. **Minimum data threshold:** XGBoost requires at least 15 training days to outperform naive averaging. Below 10 days, the model overfits and produces worse predictions than simple averages.

2. **Diminishing returns:** After 30 days of training data, additional data provides marginal improvement (~1.5% MAE reduction from 30→59 days).

3. **Feature importance distribution:** Across the synthetic user population, the most important features are typically `electricity` (mean importance: 0.28), `shopping_val` (0.22), and `transport_total` (0.18), consistent with the relative contribution of these categories to total emissions.

4. **Day-of-week effect:** The `day_of_week` feature shows low importance (mean: 0.04), suggesting that for individual users, weekday/weekend patterns are less predictive than lifestyle variables.

### 9.4 Ablation Study

To understand the contribution of each component, we conducted an ablation study:

| Configuration | MAE | vs Full System |
|---|---|---|
| **Full system** (XGBoost + SHAP + tiers + scoped) | **5.45** | baseline |
| Without data-aware tiers (always XGBoost) | 6.12 | +12.3% worse |
| Without scoped models (global model) | 6.87 | +26.1% worse |
| Without SHAP (no explanation capability) | — | User trust degraded |
| Without Digital Twin (no simulation) | — | No scenario planning |

The data-aware tier system improves performance by 12.3% because it prevents the model from making overconfident predictions with insufficient data.

## 11. Limitations & Future Work

### 11.1 Limitations

1. **Synthetic evaluation data:** The ML evaluation was conducted on synthetically generated data. Real user data may exhibit different patterns (more noise, seasonal effects, logging fatigue) that could affect model performance.

2. **Single campus test:** The multi-tenant architecture has been verified programmatically but not tested with real multi-college deployment.

3. **Model recency:** Models are trained on demand (when the user visits the dashboard). They do not automatically retrain on new data unless the user triggers a prediction request. This means stale models may persist if users do not actively use the platform.

4. **Cold start problem:** New users have no prediction capability until they log at least 3 entries (the minimum for any output).

5. **Emission factors:** The system uses static, global-average emission factors. Regional variation (e.g., grid carbon intensity varies by country) is not modeled.

6. **SHAP computation cost:** `TreeExplainer` has complexity O(TLDM²), which grows with model complexity. For very deep or numerous trees, explanation time could become a bottleneck.

### 11.2 Future Work

1. **Federated learning:** Train global models across colleges without sharing raw student data, improving model quality while preserving privacy.

2. **Automatic model retraining:** Implement a scheduler (e.g., cron + Celery) that retrains models on a regular cadence regardless of user activity.

3. **Mobile application:** React Native or Flutter implementation for native logging with GPS-based transport mode detection and smart meter integration.

4. **IoT integration:** Automatic data ingestion from smart home devices (smart meters, vehicle telematics) to reduce manual logging burden.

5. **Regional emission factors:** Database of region-specific emission factors with automatic detection based on user location/IP.

6. **Team-based challenges:** Department vs. department competition modes with real-time leaderboards.

7. **Carbon offset marketplace:** Integration with verified carbon offset programs (e.g., Gold Standard, Verra) allowing users to purchase offsets directly from the platform.

8. **Prophet-based alternative:** Evaluate Facebook Prophet for the forecasting component, which may handle seasonality better than XGBoost.

9. **Confidence calibration:** Use isotonic regression or Platt scaling to better calibrate the model's confidence estimates.

10. **A/B testing framework:** Built-in experiment framework to measure the causal impact of gamification features on user behavior.
